\section{Final remarks}
\begin{frame}{Final remarks}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Fourier Integral Method and Turning Bands Simulation are very efficient simulation algorithm based in a problem transformation.
    \item The original simulation problem is transformed in M 1D independent simulations (in the band or in the phase).
    \item We can see the spectral simulation as a way to transform the geostatistical simulation in a embarrassingly problem. 
    \item We don't need to lead with random paths.
    \item Using covariance tables, we can reduce the modeling time generating the covariance model directly from data.
    \item Spectral allows the best usage of a modern computational infrastructure like GPUs, clusters, multi-core and modern APIs like GRPC, arrayfire, openmp, CUDA, and so on.
